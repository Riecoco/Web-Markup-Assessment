          As I reflect on my freshman year, I realize that I've learned so much
          along the way. If I could give some advice to my younger self, here
          are the top five tips that I would share, hoping that they will help
          you make the most of your first year:

            <h2>1. Start Projects Sooner</h2>
            <p>
              Procrastination might feel easy in the moment, but it can
              significantly affect your grades. Starting projects early gives
              you the time to refine your work, ask questions, and make
              improvements. Whether it's a design project or coding assignment,
              the earlier you start, the more room you have for feedback and
              revisions. Trust me, those extra days of polish can make a huge
              difference.

            <h2>2. Ask for Help—A Lot!</h2>
            <p>
              I know it might feel intimidating to ask questions or seek help,
              but don't let that stop you. Whether it's reaching out to a
              teacher for clarification or emailing for feedback, it's crucial
              to stay proactive. Also, get to know your classmates. Socializing
              makes it easier to ask for help when you need it—sometimes your
              peers have great tips you might not have thought of.

            <h2>3. Avoid Retakes at All Costs</h2>
            <p>
              Retakes may seem like a second chance, but they come at a heavy
              price—time. Juggling new assignments with old ones is a recipe for
              stress and burnout. If you focus and stay organized, you can avoid
              retakes altogether. Plan your study schedule carefully, so you
              aren't cramming everything into the last minute.

            <h2>4. Don't Be Afraid of the Easy Stuff</h2>
            <p>
              You'll come across subjects that seem difficult at first, but
              don't make them harder than they are. Sometimes, we overthink the
              easy courses, believing they should be more challenging. Keep
              things simple where you can and focus your energy on the truly
              tough subjects. Don't turn a molehill into a mountain!

            <h2>5. Take Studying Seriously—Especially for Exams</h2>
            <p>
              This one may sound obvious, but skipping exams or not taking your
              study time seriously can seriously set you back. It's not just
              about passing; it's about building knowledge for your future
              career (like a friend of mine put it, make sure your company isn't
              hiring you based on a ChatGPT education(lol)). Make sure you spend
              enough time at home studying—sometimes, school won't give you all
              the learning time you need, and the extra hours make all the
              difference.

            By embracing these small but meaningful changes, you can set
            yourself up for a more enjoyable, fulfilling freshman year. Stay
            curious, stay connected, and remember—asking for help is a strength,
            not a weakness.
