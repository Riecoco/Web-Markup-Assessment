          As I reflect on my freshman year, I realize that I've learned so much
          along the way. If I could give some advice to my younger self, here
          are the top five tips that I would share, hoping that they will help
          you make the most of your first year:
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>1. Start Projects Sooner</h2>
          <p>
            Procrastination might feel easy in the moment, but it can
            significantly affect your grades. Starting projects early gives you
            the time to refine your work, ask questions, and make improvements.
            Whether it's a design project or coding assignment, the earlier you
            start, the more room you have for feedback and revisions. Trust me,
            those extra days of polish can make a huge difference.

            title="Promptly, promptly!!"
          />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>2. Ask for Help—A Lot!</h2>
          <p>
            I know it might feel intimidating to ask questions or seek help, but
            don't let that stop you. Whether it's reaching out to a teacher for
            clarification or emailing for feedback, it's crucial to stay
            proactive. Also, get to know your classmates. Socializing makes it
            easier to ask for help when you need it—sometimes your peers have
            great tips you might not have thought of.

          />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>3. Avoid Retakes at All Costs</h2>
          <p>
            Retakes may seem like a second chance, but they come at a heavy
            price—time. Juggling new assignments with old ones is a recipe for
            stress and burnout. If you focus and stay organized, you can avoid
            retakes altogether. Plan your study schedule carefully, so you
            aren't cramming everything into the last minute.

            title="Make a schedule!"
          />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>4. Don't Be Afraid of the Easy Stuff</h2>
          <p>
            You'll come across subjects that seem difficult at first, but don't
            make them harder than they are. Sometimes, we overthink the easy
            courses, believing they should be more challenging. Keep things
            simple where you can and focus your energy on the truly tough
            subjects. Don't turn a molehill into a mountain!

            title="Raise your hand in class!"
          />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>5. Take Studying Seriously—Especially for Exams</h2>
          <p>
            This one may sound obvious, but skipping exams or not taking your
            study time seriously can seriously set you back. It's not just about
            passing; it's about building knowledge for your future career (like
            a friend of mine put it, make sure your company isn't hiring you
            based on a ChatGPT education(lol)). Make sure you spend enough time
            at home studying—sometimes, school won't give you all the learning
            time you need, and the extra hours make all the difference.
          </p>

            title="Take your studies seriously!"
          />
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            By embracing these small but meaningful changes, you can set
            yourself up for a more enjoyable, fulfilling freshman year. Stay
            curious, stay connected, and remember—asking for help is a strength,
            not a weakness.
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely, A Wiser You</p>
