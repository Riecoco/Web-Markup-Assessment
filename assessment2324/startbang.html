          Beginning your first year in Information Technology (IT) is
          exciting, but it can also feel overwhelming. By equipping yourself
          with foundational knowledge, organizing your time and tools, and
          engaging with the IT community, youâ€™ll set yourself up for a
          successful journey. Letâ€™s dive into these three key strategies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="master-basics">
        <h2>1. Master The IT Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Getting familiar with fundamental IT concepts early will help you
          stay ahead in class and make challenging topics more manageable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Practice programming languages like
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0">Python</a>,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=T54eJxm4rTdX9Hdv&v=EerdGm-ehJQ&feature=youtu.be">JavaScript</a>,
            or
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=hmUhJ7DZI6Jj-gKN&v=ZzaPdXTrSb8&feature=youtu.be">C++</a>. These
            languages are building blocks in software development and
            will be part of many assignments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understand networking basics and IT fundamentals. This
            <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/IT_Fundamentals">IT Fundamentals guide</a>
            provides a starting point to learn about essential concepts such
            as networks, security, and hardware.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work with multiple operating systems. IT courses often involve
            using different platforms. Experiment with Windows, Linux, and
            macOS to familiarize yourself with their environments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Strengthening your knowledge early will make classes easier to
          follow and give you a head start on projects.

      <section class="organise">
        <h2>2. Organise Your Tech and Time</h2>
        <p>
          Success in IT isnâ€™t just about codingâ€”itâ€™s also about staying
          organized and managing your workload efficiently.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Equip yourself with the right tools. A reliable laptop with at
            least 8 GB of RAM is recommended for multitasking and coding.
            Install tools like
            <a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop/">GitHub Desktop</a> to
            manage your code versions and
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> as
            your primary text editor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use cloud storage to back up your work regularly. Google Drive or
            OneDrive can prevent data loss, while
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> allows you to collaborate
            on coding projects and manage repositories.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan your time carefully. Use
            <a href="https://aliabdaal.notion.site/The-Ultimate-Studying-Bundle-83a7aa3a1bc84688acd3fe66ce611131">The
              Ultimate Studying Bundle on Notion</a>
            to organize assignments and deadlines, ensuring that you manage
            your workload without stress.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By setting up your tech and planning ahead, youâ€™ll stay on top of
          your responsibilities and keep your mind clear for learning.

      <section class="communities">
        <h2>3. Get Involved With IT Communities</h2>
        <p>
          Learning doesnâ€™t stop in the classroomâ€”joining communities and
          working on real-world projects will sharpen your skills.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Participate in campus tech clubs and hackathons. These events are
            great opportunities to work on collaborative projects, meet new
            people, and build practical skills. Hackathons, in particular,
            provide fast-paced environments where you can solve real-world
            challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Join online communities. Engage with forums like
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> to
            troubleshoot problems or learn new coding tips from experienced
            developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborate on open-source projects.
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> offers countless projects
            where you can contribute, gain hands-on experience, and connect
            with professionals from around the world.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By actively participating in these communities, youâ€™ll gain
          insights, expand your network, and discover new ways to apply what
          you learn.
